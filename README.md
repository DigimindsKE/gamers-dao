# Gamers DAO
Gamers' DAO tries to add to the gameFI industry by enabling members of the community to have a say in the game experiences, as well as ensuring security and functionality standards are met. For a game to be accepted onto the Gamers’ DAO ecosystem, it has to be voted in by both the community (holders of the SPN token for governance) and a group of experienced web3 experts/devs.

# Goals of Gamers’ DAO
```shell
Provide a platform for new and independent web3 game devs to display their creativity
Engage the community as shareholders to create the best game scenarios and experiences
Ensure security to game users by having the DAO control in-game currencies and having game contracts well audited before they get voted on by the community
Easen up the game development process by providing Minters, Enemies and Reward generators to the games in the ecosystem

```
# Use Case Scenario
A developer in the community has a game idea that they want to add to the ecosystem. They ‘pitch’ to the community, which then proceeds to vote on whether they would want the game added. 
Once the community votes on it, the developer creates the game contracts and submits them to the tech team. The team checks whether the game is in line with their proposal and audit for security issues.  
The Dev can also request for their own in-game token, which will have the community sign off on. The dev/community may have a preference for an already voted in currency.
Once both the tech team and community has signed off, the dao allows the game into the ecosystem and gives the contract access to the ecosytem’s resources.
